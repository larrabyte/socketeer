# socketeer
 Personal journey of learning how to code in C.
 This project should work on Windows, macOS and Linux.

 To compile Socketeer, run ```make.sh```. Make sure to have a peek inside first to adjust the compilation flags. 
 If on Windows, make sure LIBRARIES contains ```-lws2_32``` to link Winsock.
 Otherwise, it should be good if you just leave it empty.

 Make sure that you have a obj/ and bin/ folder, otherwise the script breaks :(
